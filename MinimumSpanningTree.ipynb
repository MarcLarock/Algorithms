    "1. An MST is defined as a connected and edge-weighted graph without any cycles.\n",

    "3. Assume that implementing my algorithm did not produce an MST. \n",
    "4. However, when we run my algorithm, a sub-set of vertices within the graph are found such that adding an edge would result in a cycle. When my algorithm adds an edge it creates a cycle and therfore the graph is no longer an MST. Within this cycle my algorithm will then traverse all edges and delete the highest weighted edge, thereby removing the cycle.\n",
    "5. The procedure in (4) results in a connected and edge-weighted graph without any cycles, i.e., an MST.\n",
    "6. If my algorithm creates an MST, then the assumption of (3) cannot be true, since a graph cannot be both an MST and not an MST at the same time.\n",
